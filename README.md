# Sec-project

Hello World and welcome to Sec-Project written by RealGoose

I will try to use Python to showcase my software development and security skills. This program will use user input to allow them to pick an option they 
wish to proceed with. These will include Port Scanning on your host, Basic Malware Detection on the host, Best Practices, etc, with more to come.
The program will install all needed libraries and modules in order to run the program to make it as easy as I can. 

This program will serve as an application to several internships and workshops since this application will demonstrate my development and computer security skills.
This project is still in the works and the code seen here is likely not it's final version.

Have a Good Day! :)
